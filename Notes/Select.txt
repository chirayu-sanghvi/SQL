SQL SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

SELECT Syntax
    `SELECT column1, column2, ...
      FROM tablename;`

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:
  
`SELECT * FROM tablename;`

Example
The following SQL statement selects the "first_name" and "last_name" columns from the "patients" table:

`SELECT first_name, last_name FROM patients;`
